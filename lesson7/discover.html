          <h2>Yakima Skyline</h2>
          <p>
            With a population of approximately 97,000, Yakima is the largest
            city in Central Washington and the 11th largest in the state. Yakima
            is about 60 miles southeast of Mount Rainier. It is situated in the
            Yakima Valley, a productive agricultural region noted for apple,
            wine, and hop production. The name Yakima originates from the Yakama
            Nation Native American tribe, whose reservation is located south of
            the city.

          <h2>The SunDome</h2>
          <p>
            The Yakima Valley SunDome is a 6,195-seat multi-purpose arena in
            Yakima, Washington, United States. It was built in 1990, on the
            Central Washington State Fairgrounds, by contractor Gilbert H. Moen
            Co and architecture firm Loofburrow & Associates. The SunDome was
            designed to host sporting events, i.e. basketball, soccer,
            volleyball, ice shows, horse shows, circuses, boxing and concerts,
            as well as agricultural expos, trade shows, symposiums, conventions,
            and much more.

          <h2>Bins of Light</h2>
          <p>
            The piece is made up of more than 50 glass panels that have images
            of fruit on one side and silhouette-like representations of
            well-known Yakima Valley fruit labels on the other side. The fruit
            side of the panels face east and the labels side of the panels face
            west. The bin-shaped panels that make up Bins of Light are
            illuminated by sunlight during the day and by LED lights at night.
            Lights in the panels turn on and off in a pattern reminiscent of the
            stacking and unstacking of the fruit bins.

          <h2>The Palm Springs of Yakima</h2>
          <p>
            Originally this sign was posted to celebrate the centennial but
            after the centennial celebration had finished, the owner of the sign
            (Trailwagons) removed the centennial dates and words and painted in
            its place "the Palm Springs". The sign can still be seen when
            driving south on I-82.

          <h2>State Fair Animal Pens</h2>
          <p>
            Agriculture has always been central to the Yakima valley, and that
            includes livestock. At the Central Washington State Fair in Yakima,
            there are plenty of stalls for owners to proudly display all sorts
            of animals, from sheep and goats to cows and horses.

          <h2>Rides at the State Fair</h2>
          <p>
            There is plenty of entertainment and fun to be had at the Central
            Washington State Fair at State Fair Park next to the SunDome in
            Yakima, Washington. With rides, treats, food, and countless booths
            for games and vendors, there is never a dull moment.

          <h2>The Farmers Market</h2>
          <p>
            The Downtown Yakima Farmers Market (DYFM) is a great option for an
            outdoor grocery store. There are many fun events and exciting
            elements to the market. That, in addition to the featured fresh
            produce and value-added products make up the heart of the DYFM.
