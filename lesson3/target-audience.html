            Michael Nelson is looking for an event that he and his office can
            attend to be out in public and hand out cards and fliers. He wants
            his loan officers to have the chance to meet people in the community

            coffee shop in town. He is a local business owner and doesn't
            operate a chain, so he is looking for local investors. He wants to
            network with others who would be willing to invest. He looks at the
            join page in an attempt to decide which membership option would be
            best for him and his needs.

            upcoming events that the Chamber is hosting so he might attend and
            learn more. He also finds his way to the contact page and submits a
            contact form and looks through the options to learn more.
