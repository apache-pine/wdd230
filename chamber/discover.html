        <h2>Yakima Skyline</h2>
        <p>
          With a population of approximately 97,000, Yakima is the largest city
          in Central Washington and the 11th largest in the state. Yakima is
          about 60 miles southeast of Mount Rainier. It is situated in the
          Yakima Valley, a productive agricultural region noted for apple, wine,
          and hop production. The name Yakima originates from the Yakama Nation
          Native American tribe, whose reservation is located south of the city.

        <h2>The SunDome</h2>
        <p>
          The Yakima Valley SunDome is a 6,195-seat multi-purpose arena in
          Yakima, Washington, United States. It was built in 1990, on the
          Central Washington State Fairgrounds, by contractor Gilbert H. Moen Co
          and architecture firm Loofburrow & Associates. The SunDome was
          designed to host sporting events, i.e. basketball, soccer, volleyball,
          ice shows, horse shows, circuses, boxing and concerts, as well as
          agricultural expos, trade shows, symposiums, conventions, and much
          more.

        <h2>Bins of Light</h2>
        <p>
          The piece is made up of more than 50 glass panels that have images of
          fruit on one side and silhouette-like representations of well-known
          Yakima Valley fruit labels on the other side. The fruit side of the
          panels face east and the labels side of the panels face west. The
          bin-shaped panels that make up Bins of Light are illuminated by
          sunlight during the day and by LED lights at night. Lights in the
          panels turn on and off in a pattern reminiscent of the stacking and
          unstacking of the fruit bins.

        <h2>The Palm Springs of Yakima</h2>
        <p>
          Originally this sign was posted to celebrate the centennial but after
          the centennial celebration had finished, the owner of the sign
          (Trailwagons) removed the centennial dates and words and painted in
          its place "the Palm Springs". The sign can still be seen when driving
          south on I-82.

        <h2>State Fair Animal Pens</h2>
        <p>
          Agriculture has always been central to the Yakima valley, and that
          includes livestock. At the Central Washington State Fair in Yakima,
          there are plenty of stalls for owners to proudly display all sorts of
          animals, from sheep and goats to cows and horses.

          There is plenty of entertainment and fun to be had at the Central
          Washington State Fair at State Fair Park next to the SunDome in
          Yakima, Washington. With rides, treats, food, and countless booths for
          games and vendors, there is never a dull moment.

        <h2>The Farmers Market</h2>
        <p>
          The Downtown Yakima Farmers Market (DYFM) is a great option for an
          outdoor grocery store. There are many fun events and exciting elements
          to the market. That, in addition to the featured fresh produce and
          value-added products make up the heart of the DYFM.

        <h2>Population</h2>
        <p>
          Yakima is the largest city in Yakima County with a population of about
          96,000. That makes it the 11th largest city in Washington State. Most
          of the people who founded Yakima were of European descent, although
          significant numbers of African-Americans and Asian-Americans
          homesteaded here as well. Relatively recently, the Yakima Valley has
          experienced a large influx of Latino immigrants, many from the state
          of Michoacan in central Mexico. Today, the Yakima community enjoys a
          rich mixture of people from many cultural and ethnic backgrounds.
