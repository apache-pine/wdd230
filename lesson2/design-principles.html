          <p>
            In the Religious Studies Center website each individual article or
            story is linked closely together. They are separated by white space
            that is a different color than the cards that link to each article.
            A picture, the date it was published, and the first few lines of the
            article are included in each card, followed by white space on all
            sides. The white space is of a different color which makes it easier
            to distinguish. It also makes each article just a little further
            apart, making it obvious that each contains a different topic, idea,
            element, etc.

        <h3>Contrast</h3>
        <article>
          <h4>Bankrate</h4>
          <a href="https://www.bankrate.com/">https://www.bankrate.com/</a>
          <img
            src="images/contrast-bankrate.jpg"
            alt="Bankrate website screenshot"
          />
          <p>
            While the Bankrate page may not be super colorful or vibrant, it is
            very professional and legible. All the information is clear and easy
            to read because there is great contrast between the colors. The
            primary two colors are black and white, and it is tough to get any
            more contrast than what is found between those two colors. The third
            color that appears throughout the site is a darker blue, which
            contrasts well with white, but not black. Hence, there are not very
            many spots throughout the site where black can be found close to
            blue.

          <h4>Smithsonian</h4>
          <a href="https://www.si.edu/">https://www.si.edu/</a>
          <img

          />
          <p>
            Throughout the Smithsonian website one can find examples of great
            use of alignment, but especially towards the bottom of the homepage
            were everything is centered over one another. The pictures, headings
            and short descriptions are all stacked one above the other and
            centered. Just above this section the pictures are still centered;
            however, the headings and the text are all justified to the left.
            This along with the color change makes it obvious that the section
            is changing and, with it, the content and focus as well.
